Project Description: Selenium Web Testing with Pytest

This project demonstrates the use of Selenium and Pytest to implement a comprehensive test suite for a target website.
Following industry-standard conventions for Python, Selenium, and Pytest, the tests are designed to validate the site's functionality
and ensure a smooth user experience.

Key features of the project include the use of Pytest fixtures for efficient test setup and teardown, adherence to clean-code principles
for maintainable and readable test scripts, and a modular approach to test case organization. This test suite serves as a showcase for best
practices in web testing and can serve as a valuable reference for future testing projects.
